# D3 Bubble Diagram
A useful way to display a bunch of things and link out to them.
In my case, I built this page to show the technlogies we used in a project and link to a useful resource (web link), for that technology. 

Hope you can use it for something similar.

* bubbles-external.html -> *The data loaded from an external json file.*
* bubbles-internal.html -> *The data loaded embedded json.*

### To run:
**Method 1:**

* Place the files in a web server and access them.

**Method 2:** 

* If you have python installed run 

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
``` 

from inside the folder 

* You should be able to access the site at http://localhost:8000
